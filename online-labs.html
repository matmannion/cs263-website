        This page contains instructions for online labs in CS263.
    </p>


    <h3>Before the lab</h3>

    <p>
        Before your first online lab, join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dcs-cs263/signup">Slack</a> with your <code>@warwick.ac.uk</code> email address and a suitable cover identity. Make sure that you know how to access the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T8NBDMA85/C8N861X6G"><code>#labs</code></a> channel. You may wish to download the Slack app on your phone or desktop to get notifications, but you can just use the browser-based client if you do not wish to install the app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, you should familiarise yourself with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/michael_gale/2021-labs/synchronous">the process for sharing your code</a> with a tutor and install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack">VSCode Live Share</a> extension for VSCode. We recommend this for sharing code with tutors, since it will allow them to take control of your editor in the same way they would normally be able to take control of your keyboard and mouse in a &quot;normal&quot; lab. If you do not use VSCode, you can share your screen, but this limits the tutor's ability to help.
    </p>

    <h3>At the start of the lab</h3>

    <p>
        We will post a message in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T8NBDMA85/C8N861X6G"><code>#labs</code></a> channel informing you that the lab is starting and which tutors are present. Reply (in the thread) or react to this message to indicate that you are &quot;present&quot; for attendance monitoring purposes on Tabula. A screenshot of a sample message is shown below. The buttons you can use to reply or react are highlighted with a red square:

    <h3>Getting help during the lab</h3>

    <p>
        You have the following two options for getting help during the online lab:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            You can simply post your question in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T8NBDMA85/C8N861X6G"><code>#labs</code></a> channel and we will reply to it. This also potentially allows other students to answer if they are willing to do so and know the answer, so be mindful not to e.g. post anything that might reveal information about your solution to the coursework:

            <div class="image"><img src="help-message.png" /></div>
            
            Before posting a question, you may wish to use Slack's search function to see if your question has already been answered previously.

            <div class="image"><img src="search.png" /></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want more personal help and a tutor to look at your work or code, you can also post a message in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T8NBDMA85/C8N861X6G"><code>#labs</code></a> channel asking for a tutor to assist you:

            <div class="image"><img src="help-request.png" /></div>

            The next available tutor will reply to your message (to signal to other tutors that they are helping you) and then message you to arrange a voice call via Teams or Slack (depending on your preference). During this call you may then either share your screen with the tutor or your code via e.g. <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/michael_gale/2021-labs/synchronous">VSCode Live Share</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>At the end of the lab</h3>

    <p>
        We will post a message indicating when the lab is about to end to let you know that staff may not be as readily available as during the lab. You can continue asking questions in the channel after this and we will reply as soon as we can.
